1. Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and prints out the next leap year.
Year: 2023
The next leap year after 2023 is 2024

2. If the user inputs a year which is a leap year (such as 2024), the program should print out the following leap year:
Year: 2024
The next leap year after 2024 is 2028

solution

year = int(input('Year: '))
atp = 0
while True:
    #year_new = year
    if year%4 != 0:   #not a leap year
        year += 1
        atp += 1
    if year%4 == 0 :  # might be a leap year
        if year%100 == 0:
            if year%400 == 0:  # a lear year
                break
            else:             # not a leap year
                year += 1
                atp += 1
        else:       # a leap year
            break

# print(year)
# print(year+4)
# print(year+8)
# print(year-atp)
# print(atp)


if atp == 0:
    if (year+4)%100 == 0:
        if (year+4)%400 == 0:
            print(f'The next leap year after {year} is {year+4}')
        else:
            print(f'The next leap year after {year} is {year+8}')
    else:
        print(f'The next leap year after {year} is {year+4}')
else:
    print(f'The next leap year after {year-atp} is {year}')
